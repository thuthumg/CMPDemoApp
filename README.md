## Features

- Authentication Flow (Login)
- Home Screen
- Sample List Screen
- Detail Screen
- Settings Screen
- Camera Access
- Online & Offline Support
- Shared UI and Logic across Android & iOS

## Architecture

CMPDemoApp follows **Clean Architecture** with strict separation of concerns and modular layers:

- **Presentation Layer**  
  Jetpack Compose UI (shared) with **MVI pattern** for predictable state management.

- **Domain Layer**  
  Platform-independent business logic and use cases.

- **Data Layer**  
  Abstracted repositories using:
  - **Ktor** for API communication
  - **SQLDelight** for type-safe local database access

- **Dependency Injection**  
  Powered by **Koin**, configured for multiplatform usage.
